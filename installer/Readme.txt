Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this project is to provide a simplified and quicker way of getting 
logs from a server cluster. The tool will log on to each server in the cluster 
using ssh and commands can be run to retrieve logs. The logs will be displayed 
to the user on a single interface.
